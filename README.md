npm start , will start the server
npm run share, will generate a public url where others can view my local work
for other commands check package.json

we use  express to create the server
				babel for transpiling
				webpack for bundling
				npm scripts for automation
				ESLint for linting
				mocha for testing
				
webpack creates a file which we called bundle.js, and import it in index.html
				the file does not exist physically, but it is in memory
				
to see the original code you write, in the browser, 
	use source maps aka(the debugger) in your code, to set breakpoints				

if you work in react you can use eslint-plugin-react
